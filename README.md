![Console Output](https://siasky.net/IAAUVxMPHmQjyubF8sGpRuoSQFg0bpKqxgB83quECbESmQ)

# Objective
Develop a client-side Bitcoin wallet address generator.

# Usage
Open cmd in the directory with keys.py or keyloop.py and input either one.
keys.py runs once, while keyloop.py allows user input to dictate the amount of times the code is run.

# Use cases
In applications that an individual wants to generate a Bitcoin address on the fly, completely random (uses urandom) while not requiring a network connection.

# Future Plans
Add functionality to generate the matching public address, in the case a user wants to actually use this wallet.

# Requires
Base58 (pip install base58)

Bitcoin (pip install bitcoin)
